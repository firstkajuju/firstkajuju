👋 Hi, I’m Tom Kelvin!

👀 I’m passionate about the automation of programming tasks and streamlining development workflows through the power of automation tools like Kubernetes (kubectl) and Docker.

🌱 Currently, I'm diving deeper into the realms of automation, sharpening my skills in scripting, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects related to automation, DevOps practices, and cloud-native technologies. Let's work together to build efficient and scalable solutions!

📫 You can reach me via email at tommac379@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I believe that automation is not just about saving time, but it's also about empowering developers to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation. Let's automate the boring stuff and unleash our potential!
